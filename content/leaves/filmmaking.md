Hopi student Victor Masayesva, Jr. writes a senior thesis on “Hopi Oral Tradition,” despite his resistance to writing in languages other than Hopi. He returns to his community after graduate school (University of Arizona), where he begins to create an award-winning body of work of oral histories, photography, and documentary films. Using these expressive forms, he develops a form of poetic image-making based in Native American philosophies and practices and made in the lands where they originate. Some of these works confront the Hollywood imagination of Native Americans as well as the conditions in which they are employed as movie extras (e.g. Imagining Indians).
