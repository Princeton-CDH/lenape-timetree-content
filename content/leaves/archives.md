title: Online Library Collection on Indigenous Cultures
---

The Princeton University Library publishes the [online collection of the American Indian Affairs records]( https://dpul.princeton.edu/indigenous-cultures) which includes over 240 digitized books and manuscripts, some selected by librarians and others requested by Indigenous researchers. Records include land deeds, missionary-created language dictionaries and translations of religious documents. Graduate students work with librarians to create searchable Munsee dictionaries from the newly-digitized books.
