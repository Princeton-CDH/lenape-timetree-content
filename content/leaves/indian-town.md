New Jersey officially recognizes the stateâ€™s Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Nation and its hometown in Bridgeton (86 miles from Princeton). (After a federal lawsuit on the part of the tribe, the state officially re-recognizes the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape as a tribe.) While the origination of the term Indian Town is unclear, the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape Tribal Office in Bridgeton has said there are more than 12,000 members of the Lenape Tribe in the surrounding region. Held until 2019, the annual two-day pow-wow hosts members of tribal nations across the United States and received about 10,000 spectators.
