[Nuclear Princeton](https://nuclearprinceton.princeton.edu) is an undergraduate-directed project that reveals the impacts of the nuclear sciences and the management of U.S. national security on Native lands, communities, and beyond. Beginning with the Manhattan Project, it locates the histories of toxic environmental racism and the contemporary technoscientific management of U.S. national security.
