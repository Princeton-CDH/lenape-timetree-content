William Penn and others divide up Lunaape lands across the Delaware Valley into separate colonies and property holdings. For the Unami LÃ«napesee the Delaware River, or Lenapewihittuck, is the unifying center of their territory, but it becomes, for settlers, the dividing line between the New Jersey and Pennsylvania colonies.
