1772 (?) Bartholomew Scott Calvin (Shawukukhkung or Wilted Grass) (Delaware) matriculates at College of NJ, sponsored by the Scottish Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge; but funds cut off during Revolutionary War and Calvin has to drop out (though he has a successful career as a teacher and Delaware leader â€“ see 1832 challenge to Treaty of Easton). His father was a translator at the Treaty of Easton (?).
