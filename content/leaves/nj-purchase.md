In 1677, Quakers “purchase” all Lunaape land from Sassackon (Timber Creek) to Rancocas Creek, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware River. The deal is made with Chief Katemus Sekappio. Payment is in the form of thirty guns, thirty axes, thirty hoes, thirty jewsharps, one hundred fishhooks, brandy, and other trinkets.
