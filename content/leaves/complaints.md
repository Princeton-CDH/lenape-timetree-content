Alarmed by rising hostilities between colonial and Native peoples across the Delaware River, in neighboring Pennslyvania, the governor of the New Jersey Colony holds meetings in Crosswicks (approximately than 18 miles south of Princeton) to hear grievances from Lunaapeew. As missionary David Brainerd writes, months later, "A bill is passed to remove the difficulties which had grown out of impositions upon the Indians when intoxicated, the destruction of deer by traps, and the occupation of lands by the whites which they had not sold." A number of Native land claims are settled and the land is secured for the mission town of Brotherton. The Crosswicks meeting leads to another in 1758 with the Governor, where Native diplomats request a date for the eventual conference at Easton, amid ongoing aggression in Eastern Pennslyvania and New York.
