Not only is Thomas and John Penns' deed itself highly suspect, but they recruit runners, not walkers, for the job of the 1737 “Walking Purchase.” Colonial agents clear a path for the runners in a reconnaissance of the territory beforehand. As a result, the Penn brothers seize 750,000 acres of Lunaape land.
