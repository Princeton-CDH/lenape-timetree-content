In 1774 Bartholomew Scott Calvin (Shawukukhkung or Wilted Grass) (Lunaape) matriculates at the College of New Jersey, sponsored by the Scottish Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. Funds are cut off during the Revolutionary War, and Calvin has to drop out. However, he has a successful career as a teacher and Lunaape leader (see the 1832 challenge to Treaty of Easton). His father Steven Calvin was a translator at the Treaty of Easton.
