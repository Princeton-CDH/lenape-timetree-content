Brotherton Indians release statement of refusal to leave New Jersey, after Oneidas in Stockbridge New York invite Brothertonâ€™s remaining members to join them. By 1802 the 80 remaining residents successfully petition the state legislature for permission to sell their land and use the funds to move to Oneida Lake in New York.
