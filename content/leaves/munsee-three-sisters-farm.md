title: Munsee Three Sisters Farm
---
Created to rebuild community and well-being among Munsee Ramapough clans after centuries of colonial violence, beginning with the Ramapough massacre in 1644 and continuing through a century of state-sanctioned industrial poisoning. The Turtle clan, for instance, has lived for 56 years in a federal superfund site. The farm cultivates healthy traditionally grown food for distribution at no cost through the community, while also earning a profit in the marketplace. The Munsee Three Sisters Farm is connected with land conservancies in efforts to reclaim sacred landscapes, hunting sites, and cultural landmarks.
