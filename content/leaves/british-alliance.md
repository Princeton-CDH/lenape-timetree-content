Most New Jersey Lunaape and Lunaapeew reject the invitation from western Delawares to join them in the Ohio Valley. In the mid-late 1700s, the eve of American Revolutionary War, most Delaware groups are living along Ohio and Allegheny rivers. Pro-British Delawares live in what is today northwestern Ohio, and pro-American Delawares near the frontier city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
