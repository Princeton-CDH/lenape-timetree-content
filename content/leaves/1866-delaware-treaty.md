The Delaware purchase a 10-by-30 mile tract of land from the Cherokee Nation situated along the upper Caney River valley (in what is Oklahoma-Kansas today). In 1866, Delaware Chief John Conner writes to Cherokee Chief William P. Ross (Princeton alum) confirming the sale and stating his choice of the “preservation” over “incorporation” option, consistent with 1866 U.S Treaty with the Cherokee. The Delaware Tribe of Indians maintains tribal integrity, vouching to preserve tribal organization in ways not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the Cherokee.
