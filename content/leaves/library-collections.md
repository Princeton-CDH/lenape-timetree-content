title: Online Library Collection on Indigenous Cultures
---

The Association on American Indian Affairs donates its records to the Princeton University Library. (They are later made [available online in 2023](https://dpul.princeton.edu/indigenous-cultures)). The collection includes organizational files, books, audiovisual material, language dictionaries, and translations of religious documents from 1851-2016 (mostly 1922-1995). 

The University Library deepens its commitment to indigenous studies with the newly organized [Indigenous Studies Libguide](https://libguides.princeton.edu/IndigenousStudies), the Indigenous Cultures online collection, and a  digitized collection of Lunaapee/Delaware language items.
